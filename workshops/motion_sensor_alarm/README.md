# Arduino based Motion sensor alarm


## Required components/parts

- Arduino UNO or Arduino UNO compatible boards
- USB Cable ( may vary )
- Breadboard
- Jumper Wires
- An LED ( whatever color you want )
- 330 ohm - 1K  1/4W Resistor
- 5V buzzer
- An HC-SR501 Motion sensor module

## Wiring diagram of the HC-SR501 sensor

Note: If motion is detected then the digital output of the sensor will be a `HIGH` state. If no motion is detected then the digital output will be in a `LOW` state.

# Letâ€™s Get Started

## 1. Install the Arduino IDE


Download the appropriate Arduino IDE for your machine from the [Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

For some Arduino compatible boards that use the CH340G/C download these [drivers](http://www.wch.cn/downloads/CH341SER_EXE.html) to avoid any issues. 

## 2. Connect the components

Follow this wiring diagram below to see how the components should be connected

![](https://cloud-dg5ajyg2z.vercel.app/wiring-diagram.png)

Arduino UNO I/O connections:
`13` -> `Anode of LED ( the longer leg of the LED )`
`11` -> `Positive side of buzzer`
`12` -> `Output of HR-SR501 sensor`

## 3. Create new a sketch and paste this code 

```cpp
int led = 13;   // our LED pin
int motion_sensor = 12;  // the motion sensor pin
int buzzer = 11; // the buzzer pin


void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);  // set this as an output 
  pinMode(motion_sensor, INPUT); // set this as an input
  pinMode(buzzer, OUTPUT); // set this as an output 

  Serial.begin(9600);  // Initialize serial communication at a baud rate of 9600

}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

  int sensor_value = digitalRead(motion_sensor);

  if (sensor_value == 1) {    // what happens if motion is detected
    Serial.println("Intruder detected !"); // print out that an intruder was detected
    digitalWrite(led, HIGH);  // turn the LED on
    digitalWrite(buzzer, HIGH); // make the buzzer buzz in a sequence
    delay(50);
    digitalWrite(buzzer, LOW);
    delay(50);
  }else {      // what happens if no motion is detected
    Serial.println("No Intruder detected !"); // print out that no intruder was detected
    digitalWrite(buzzer, LOW); // the buzzer is off
    digitalWrite(led, LOW); // the LED is off
  }
}
```

## 4. Upload the code



First select your board in Tools > Board ( in this case Arduino Uno ) and then select your board's COM port in Tools > Port
After you've done that press this icon as shown in the image below to upload the program to the board

You should also be getting this in your serial monitor which can access by going to Tools > Serial Monitor or Ctrl+Shift+M
